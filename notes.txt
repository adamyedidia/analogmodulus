L is oversampling ratio
n is # observations
we want MSE
add the quantizer
compare to pure quantizer
have SNR in dB
modulo and quantize

to do D
squareroot 12 d equals the size of the quantization cell

and the size of the quantization cell is just the total space over 2^numbits in the quantizer
ok and then after we have this we can add the modulo
